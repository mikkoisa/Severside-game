##Local multiplayer game

In this application, multiple people in the same location can play games together using their mobile devices as controllers. The games are displayed in a screen, typically the screen of a PC. The players can then join the same game room and play together in the same game. 

After choosing the game from the main menu, the client using PC can create the game room with "Create Room"- button. Then the players can use "Join Room" to join the game. The players are asked to type the room password, which is displayed on the host-device's screen (i.e. PC's screen). The game can be then started from any player'sÂ  device.
